## Description

Fog of War Fixer helps [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) GMs manage the explored map (or "disperse the fog-of-war") in a Scene.
- To synchronize all players' explored maps (including those who aren't logged on), tap the Synchronize button in the Lighting menu. Great for players who miss a session, or to simulate sharing notes, or a party with a Telepathic Bond.
- OR highlight a portion of the map with lights and tap the Reveal Map button to simulate a found map or gained intelligence (COMING SOON!)
- OR reset a portion of the map inadvertently shown (COMING SOON!)
